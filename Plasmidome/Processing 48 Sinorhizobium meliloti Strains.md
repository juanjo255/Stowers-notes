# Objective

48 Strains of S. meliloti were sequenced using PacBio HiFi with the objective create a plasmidome and develop a tool that can accurately predict accessory plasmids in metagenomic samples.

# Data Quality

Check here a TSV for description of these datasets: [stats_ubam.tsv](https://webfs/n/projects/jp2992/Plasmidome_project_MOLNG_4509/stats_ubam.tsv)

In summary, that is high quality with mean read length between 9kb-13kb

# Genome assembly and plasmid prediction


Genome assembly was performed using this custom pipeline: `/n/projects/jp2992/Plasmidome_project_MOLNG_4509/code/accessory_pls_pipeline.sh`
