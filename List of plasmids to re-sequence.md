The list will be in this excel: [list_strains_w_pls_to_sequencing.xlsx]()

The list will contain in red those with:
1. A reference in the NCBI
2. Those with no acc. pls according to Samantha's result.

Samantha's result showed that:
	1. No RepABC, no Relaxase or MPF and plsdb match can still indicate plasmid, for example:
		- In Pacbio collaborator:
			- strain004 had one intermedia and one fishy. Gel showed 2 pls.
		- in MAG strains:
			- MAG722B, MAG278 and MAG514 did not present  RepABC, no Relaxase or MPF and plsdb match.
