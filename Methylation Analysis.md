# Antecedents 

This interesting study: [The Complex Epigenetic Panorama in the Multipartite Genome of [...] Sinorhizobium meliloti](https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evae245) presented the *methylome* (6mA and 4mC) of S. meliloti and the found some *core* and *disposable* methylation-target motif. I gathered the motifs in a [spreadsheet](https://webfs/n/projects/jp2992/MOLNG4331/methylation_analysis/#:~:text=methylation_motifs_pan%2Depigenome_paper.xlsx) 

They also created a software [MeStudio](https://github.com/combogenomics/MeStudio) to "analyse and combine genome-wide methylation profiles with genomic features." 


# Data


My interest is to inspect how methylation pattern looks like compared to the WT (1021). 

So, as of Oct-2025, I will be using the same data assembled in [Project-report-cbio.mm2883.102.html](https://webfs/n/projects/jp2992/Stowers-notes/Project-report-cbio.mm2883.102.html)
